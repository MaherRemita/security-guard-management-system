## Design Patterns

### Service Layer Pattern

All business logic is abstracted into service classes (`app/Services`) to keep controllers lean and focused on HTTP handling. This provides:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Controllers handle HTTP, Services handle business logic
- **Reusability**: Services can be used across multiple controllers
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic are isolated
